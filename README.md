# The Box-Sizer

link to project: https://dilinar.github.io/the-box-sizer/

When my little yarn shop grew, more orders came in. Not excluding wholesale orders. 


This brought a new challenge with it. Mainly: how do I get a large quantity of skeins abroad using the services of the Polish post? 

The main issue was getting it all to fit in a box, that did not exceed the limitations set by them. The max length can not exceed 150 cm and the circumference measured perpendicular to the length could not exceed 300 cm. So every time I needed to change one dimension, I've had to recalculate the rest. This was kind of problematic, and I could have used an app for that, so I wrote one. 

The Box-Sizer is not perfect, you can set the width or height to exceed the length, which would de facto make it the new length, but it serves its purpose.

Hope you like it ;)


# Extended bio

## This repository serves as storage for my projects and apps that I think will be a good introduction to my skills for a potential employer. 

The projects presented here are finished. They reflect my current level of knowledge and programming skills. Although they are done, I'll be upgrading them when I gain the required knowledge to do so.

## Personal introduction.

My name is Szymon, but You can call me Simon if You like. After having multiple jobs first in physical labor and later on a couple of office jobs, I've started my own business in March 2019, although it was a startup for a couple of months before that. I wanted to work for myself and be artistically active. So I've opened a shop with hand-dyed yarn known as Slavica Yarns. 

Somewhere down the road, I got annoyed by my current online shop provider, so I've decided to learn to program and create my own. I was already using basic HTML and CSS to style the various pages in my shop, so how hard could it be? I admit, I've bitten off more than I could chew, learning to be a full-stack developer in a year was madness. 

Even Though I was doomed to fail in creating my own online shop in a year, I've been bitten by the programming bug (pun intended ;P) and what was supposed to be a means to an end became my hobby of sorts. I was fascinated by what my mentor (a full-stack React developer) could do, how fast and easy it is for him to create all sorts of functionalities and logic. I know I have a long way to go, but that is what I would like to achieve. One day I would like to be able to sit down and write a whole web page or app from A to Z. I especially like writing logic, styling ain't much my thing, but figuring out the proper combination of functions, calling other functions, influencing multiple states at the same time to create the required result is my jam. Not that I'm much better at it than styling though. 

Hope You'll enjoy what You find in this repository. 

Have a nice day!
